# Building-AI-Project
Building a new Ai project in a corse
# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Just testing this for the first time

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cme](me.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   Food i like = ['Oxfilé', 'Lammfilé', 'Pizza', 'Burgare', 'Ost']
   Tillbehör = [pommes, potatis, sallad, sås, ost]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   Blabla data = [japp, jösses, hoho, hihi, hahaha]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Johanna      | Johansson |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Namn      | Efternamn       |
| för   | japp        |

## Challenges

Understand all English

## What next?

I want to become a master in AI hahahahahahha
